## Contribution opportunities:
- Create an issue for any question you have
- Docs
- Feedback on this library's API and code
- Test it on non-windows platforms, report any issues you find
- Showcase your app
- Add an example that uses Elm or Rust compiled to asm.js
- Add a PureScript example that does two-way communication with the backend
- Contribute to the original webview library: E.g. [add HDPI support on Windows](https://github.com/zserge/webview/issues/54)
- Make it possible to create the webview window as a child window of a given parent window. This would allow webview to be used for the GUIs of [VST audio plugins in Rust](https://github.com/rust-dsp/rust-vst).

### Ideas for apps:
- Rust IDE (by porting [xi-electron](https://github.com/acheronfail/xi-electron) to web-view)
- Data visualization / plotting lib for Rust, to make Rust more useful for data science
- Crypto coin wallet
- IRC client, or client for other chat protocols
- Midi song editor, VJ controller
- Rust project template wizard: Generate new Rust projects from templates with user-friendly steps
- GUI for [pijul](https://pijul.org/)
